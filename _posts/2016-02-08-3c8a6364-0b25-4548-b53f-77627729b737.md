Situated at the end of a private cul-de-sac in the Estates Section of Palm Beach, this home will just as easily play host to a high-society affair as to an intimate evening with your closest friends & family. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/45e471ed-c32d-40a5-b075-ba7a5a46e96f.jpg)

Picturesque sunset views provide a palate of colors each evening across the lake to a mangrove archipelago, providing privacy from the intracoastal waterway and direct ocean access beyond. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/52045c4e-2468-4a67-b813-6cac00047bb4.jpg)

The home includes 6 bedrooms, with maid quarters, 5 full baths and two powder rooms off the entry rotunda for those evening galas. Regent Park, a designated historic district, is home to this 1959 Clarence Mack designed treasure. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b7e31ee3-cf6f-4e40-b897-b2b5de1fa36a.jpg)

Clarence Mack once lived in the home next door, but you can easily imagine this as his favorite. As a high-society architect who began designing Palm Beach estates after the depression era, this is the finest example of his Regency Style. 
Clarence Mack was a native of Ohio and a self-taught architect who based his designs upon Georgian architecture and his travels through Europe before settling in Palm Beach in the 1930's. His style embraced classical components while incorporating modern concepts to appeal to the time and his style has survived the generations. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4714fc92-2b2b-481f-94ea-d68e52f8b7b4.jpg)

Large stately rooms with 12' ceilings, over-sized crown molding, millwork details and an open floor plan are just some of the elements in this estate that make the design timeless and as relevant today as the day it was built more than five decades ago. 
Real estate is and always will be about location. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/eb799c2f-9729-4c2b-bc40-4fa4b10012bd.jpg)

Regent Park is in the South End, just across the Southern Boulevard causeway onto the Island and South of the round-a-bout, Mar-a-Lago (once Marjorie Merriweather Post's private estate) and the Palm Beach Bath & Tennis Club. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d94d03b2-0d3d-4afe-a2e8-64ad4167d1d4.jpg)

Home to 5 private estates. Regent Park is one of only seven designated historic districts on the Island of Palm Beach. It is an example of Mack's post-war era design. You can imagine Mack's excitement as he traced the home sites of the master plan. Only three of the estates would be waterfront, and only one could take the position as the crown jewel: 500 Regent Park.
